#TERMINOLOGIES OF CRYPTOGRAPHY

#PLAIN TEXT - Text which is readable and understandable by all users.

#CIPHER TEXT - The message obtained after applying cryptography on plain text.

#ENCRYPTION - The process of converting cipher text to plain text. It is also called ENCODING.

#DECRYPTION - The process of converting cipher text to plain text. It is also called DECODING.


#BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY:

#1 It operates on bit sequences.
#2 It uses mathematical algorithms for securing the information
#3 It requires parties interested in secure communication channel to achieve privacy


#DOUBLE STRENGTH ENCRYPTION
#Double strength encryption, also known as MULTIPLE ENCRYPTION, is the process of encrypting an already encrypted text one or more times, either with the same or different algorithm/pattern.

#LEVELS OF DOUBLE STRENGTH ENCTYPTION
#First layer of encryption, Second and Third layer of encryption. CHECK REFERENCE.

#HYBRID CRYPTOGRAPHY
#Is the process of using multiple ciphers of differenct types together by including benefits of each of the cipher.

#TYPES OF CIPHERS
#1. Reverse cipher
#2. Caeser cipher
#3. ROT13 cipher
