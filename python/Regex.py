#CHARACTER CLASSES
# \d                Any numeric digit from 0 to 9
# \D                Any character that is not a numeric digit from 0 to 9
# \w                Any letter, numeric digit, or the underscore character
# \W                Any character that is not a letter, numeric digit, or the underscore character
# \s                Any space, tab, or newline character.
# \S                Any character that is not a space, tab, or newline character.

#The character class [0-5] will match only the numbers 0 to 5; this is much shorter than typing (0|1|2|3|4|5).


#MAKING YOUR OWN CHARACTER CLASS
#the character class [aeiouAEIOU] will match any vowel, both lowercase and uppercase.
#the character class [a-zA-Z0-9] will match all lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers.

#By placing a caret character (^) just after the character classâ€™s opening bracket, you can make a
# negative character class. A negative character class will match all the characters that are not in
# the character class.

#THE CARET(^) AND DOLLAR($) SIGN CHARACTERS
# ^ at the start of a regex to indicate that  a match must occur at the beginning of the searched text.
# $ at the end of the regex to indicate the string must end with this regex pattern.

#THE WILDCARD CHARACTER (.)
# will match any character except for a newline.

#MATCHING EVERYTHING WITH DOT-STAR (.*)

#MATCHING NEWLINES WITH THE DOT CHARACTER BY PASSING re.DOTALL as the second argument to re.compile('')
#E.g: newlineRegex = re.compile('.*', re.DOTALL)


#CASE INSENSITIVE MATCHING BY PASSING re.I or re.IGNORECASE
#E.g: robocop = re.compile(r'robocop', re.I)


#SUBSTITUTING STRINGS WITH THE sub METHOD. Check reference

#FORMAT THE REGEX ON MULTILINE ignoring white space and comments. Check reference.
